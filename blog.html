                    pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
                    and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
                    duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil
                    and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour,
                    when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to
                    do what we like best <br> Every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in
                    certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it
                    will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances
                    accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of se
                    pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
